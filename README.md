# pyclsclear
Simple screen clearing.
This is not pythonic at all, and should never be used in a program.
But it's a must for people like me who instinctively type clear
a lot when using a terminal.

## Installation

- Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Hegdahl/pyclsclear

## Usage

```
